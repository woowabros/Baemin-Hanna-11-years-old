# Baemin Hanna 11 years old

![Example image](/documentation/image.png)

Hanna(한나) is a typeface inspired by 1960s and 1970s signs that were cut out with a knife by pasting sheet paper over an acrylic board, giving it a jagged, unformed look. By correcting the uneven spaces between the letters in the initial version, 'Hanna' later underwent a major upgrade in 2015 and became 'Hanna 11 years old'.
